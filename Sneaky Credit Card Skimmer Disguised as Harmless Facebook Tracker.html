                <p>
                    Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a credit card skimmer that's concealed within a fake Meta
                    Pixel tracker script in an attempt to evade detection.

                    Sucuri said that the malware is injected into websites through tools that allow for custom code,
                    such as WordPress plugins like Simple Custom CSS and JS or the "Miscellaneous Scripts" section of
                    the Magento admin panel.<br><br>

                    "Custom script editors are popular with bad actors because they allow for external third party (and
                    malicious) JavaScript and can easily pretend to be benign by leveraging naming conventions that
                    match popular scripts like Google Analytics or libraries like JQuery," security researcher Matt
                    Morrow said.<br><br>

                    The bogus Meta Pixel tracker script identified by the web security company contains similar elements
                    as its legitimate counterpart, but a closer examination reveals the addition of JavaScript code that
                    substitutes references to the domain "connect.facebook[.]net" with "b-connected[.]com."<br><br>
                </p>
                <P>

                    While the former is a genuine domain linked to the Pixel tracking functionality, the replacement
                    domain is used to load an additional malicious script ("fbevents.js") that monitors if a victim is
                    on a checkout page, and if so, serves a fraudulent overlay to grab their credit card
                    details.<br><br>

                    It's worth noting that "b-connected[.]com" is a legitimate e-commerce website that has been
                    compromised at some point to host the skimmer code. What's more, the information entered into the
                    fake form is exfiltrated to another compromised site ("www.donjuguetes[.]es").<br><br>

                    To mitigate such risks, it's recommended to keep the sites up-to-date, periodically review admin
                    accounts to determine if all of them are valid, and update passwords on a frequent basis.

                    This is particularly important as threat actors are known to leverage weak passwords and flaws in
                    WordPress plugins to gain elevated access to a target site and add rogue admin users, which are then
                    used to perform various other activities, including adding additional plugins and backdoors.<br><br>

                <p>

                    "Because credit card stealers often wait for keywords such as 'checkout' or 'onepage,' they may not
                    become visible until the checkout page has loaded," Morrow said.<br> <br>

                    "Since most checkout pages are dynamically generated based on cookie data and other variables passed
                    to the page, these scripts evade public scanners and the only way to identify the malware is to
                    check the page source or watch network traffic. These scripts run silently in the background."<br>
                    <br>

                    The development comes as Sucuri also revealed that sites built with WordPress and Magento are the
                    target of another malware called Magento Shoplift. Earlier variants of Magento Shoplift have been
                    detected in the wild since September 2023.<br> <br>


                    The attack chain starts with injecting an obfuscated JavaScript snippet into a legitimate JavScript
                    file that's responsible for loading a second script from jqueurystatics[.]com via WebSocket Secure
                    (WSS), which, in turn, is designed to facilitate credit card skimming and data theft while
                    masquerading as a Google Analytics script.<br> <br>

                    "WordPress has become a massive player in e-commerce as well, thanks to the adoption of Woocommerce
                    and other plugins that can easily turn a WordPress site into a fully-featured online store,"
                    researcher Puja Srivastava said.<br> <br>

                    "This popularity also makes WordPress stores a prime target — and attackers are modifying their
                    MageCart e-commerce malware to target a wider range of CMS platforms."<br> <br>
